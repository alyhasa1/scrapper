- Inspected `ECOMWITH YASIR STOCK PRODUCTS SHEET (1).xlsx` to confirm listing and variation data structure.
- Captured eBay variation DOM via DevTools MCP for baseline (size and colour listbox markup).
- Implemented `ebay_stock_scraper.py` to read spreadsheet rows, fetch listing pages, and infer stock status with BeautifulSoup, including retry and bot-challenge handling.
- Noted eBay bot challenge responses and introduced cookie header support for manual bypass if required.
- Inspected refreshed workbook layout (STATUS now column M) and updated helper to detect headers dynamically.
- Expanded Excel column normalization in `load_variants_from_excel` to use new SIZE/Colour headers and keep STATUS mapping resilient.
- Adjusted workbook writer to resolve the STATUS column dynamically before applying updates, covering future column shifts.
